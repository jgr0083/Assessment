# Apache Log4j 2.13.0 Release Notes

The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.13.0 release!

Apache Log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade
to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides
many other modern features such as support for Markers, lambda expressions for lazy logging,
property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a PatternLayout and asynchronous
Loggers. Another notable Log4j 2 feature is the ability to be "garbage-free" (avoid allocating
temporary objects) while logging. In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

The artifacts may be downloaded from https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html.

This release contains bugfixes and minor enhancements. Some of the new features in this release are:

1. Log4j 2 now requires Java 8 or higher to build and run.
1. Experimental support for Log4j 1 configuration files. See
[Log4j 2 Compatiblity with Log4j 1](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x//manual/compatiblity.html).
1. The Logger API has been enhanced to support a builder pattern. This can dramatically improve the overhead of
capturing location information. See [Log Builder](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x//manual/logbuilder.html).
1. Better integration with Spring Boot by providing access to Spring variables in Log4j 2 configuration files and
allowing Log4j 2 system properties to be defined in the Spring configuration.
See [Logging in the Cloud](manual/cloud.html#Managing_Logging_Configuration).
1. Support for accessing Kubernetes information via a Log4j 2 Lookup.
1. The Gelf Layout now allows the message to be formatted using a PatternLayout pattern.
[Logging in the Cloud](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x//manual/cloud.html#Log4j_Configuration) provides an example of this, as well
as the use of the Spring and Kubernetes Lookups.

Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
log4j-slf4j-impl should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and log4j-slf4j18-impl should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and
later.

Note that the XML, JSON and YAML formats changed in the 2.11.0 release: they no longer have the "timeMillis" attribute
and instead have an "Instant" element with "epochSecond" and "nanoOfSecond" attributes.

The Log4j 2.13.0 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.
